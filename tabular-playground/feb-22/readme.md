For the March edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series you're challenged to forecast twelve-hours of traffic flow in a U.S. metropolis. The time series in this dataset are labelled with both location coordinates and a direction of travel -- a combination of features that will test your skill at spatio-temporal forecasting within a highly dynamic traffic network.

Which model will prevail? The venerable linear regression? The deservedly-popular ensemble of decision trees? Or maybe a cutting-edge graph neural-network? We can't wait to see!

In this competition, you'll forecast twelve-hours of traffic flow in a major U.S. metropolitan area. Time, space, and directional features give you the chance to model interactions across a network of roadways.
