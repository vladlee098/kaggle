We've heard your feedback from the 2021 Tabular Playground Series, and now Kaggle needs your help going forward in 2022!

There are two (fictitious) independent store chains selling Kaggle merchandise that want to become the official outlet for all things Kaggle. We've decided to see if the Kaggle community could help us figure out which of the store chains would have the best sales going forward. So, we've collected some data and are asking you to build forecasting models to help us decide.

For this challenge, you will be predicting a full year worth of sales for three items at two stores located in three different countries. This dataset is completely fictional, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. The dataset is small enough to allow you to try numerous different modeling approaches.
